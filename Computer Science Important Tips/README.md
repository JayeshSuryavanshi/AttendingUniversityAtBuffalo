- Choose 2 couses from your specialized field. 1 MUST be 600-level course. The other can be 500 or 600 level course. These are depth requirements.
- Choose 1 additonal course from same/any other Breadth. It can be 500/600 level.

## How to know the difficulty of the course?
- Best way is to audit the class and attend the first lecture. On the first day the presentation has all logistics mentioned. If you cannot audit, ask a friend who has to share the ppt with you that has the logistics.
- When in doubt email the professor. Find all faculty email ids here: https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/people/faculty-directory.html
- Refer for timings, schedule, number of lectures and hours of lectures from the official website to understand how many hours you will be spending in lectures.
For Spring 2021 batch the link is: http://www.buffalo.edu/class-schedule?switch=showcourses&semester=spring&division=2&dept=CSE
- 1 credit = 2 hours of study/week. So for a course of 4 credits you will be spending 8-10 hours of study time per week. So for 4 courses, 12 credits in total it will amount to 40hrs/week of study time (this is an approximate).
- Diffuculty level of a course depends on 3 factors:
  - Professor's teaching style
  - Course sturcture
  - Your hardwork
- Course structure can one or more of these components
  - Assignments (usually takes a week to complete. Most times has 10-20% weightage)
  - Project Assignments (usually taeks 2 weeks to complete. Most times has 20-30% weightage)
  - Project (usually is semester long, or can also be month long projects. Most time has <50% weightage)
  - Quiz (usually is weekly or everytime you attend the class. Most times has 5-10% weightage)
  - Mid Term Exam (There can be upto 2 mid-terms. Usually has 20-40% weightage)
  - Final Term Exam (Usually has 30-40% weightage. In some courses can also be more).
  - Class participation (Usually has 5% weightage and is kept to keep you consistent in attending classes) </br>
___Do note that course can have a combination of these components. Depends on the professor.___

## What is a Seminar, Independent Study, Supervised Research?
- Seminar: Used to explore a topic and have small hands on. Mostly involves reading research papers and presenting. Can also have projects. Seminars with project are considered has hard difficulty.
- Independent Study: You can opt this only if the professor agrees. This course needs to be forced registers. You may or may not be paid for it. Your grades depend on the quality of work you present. This is something like, each week you show progress in the work assigned to you and you should be a good student in the eyes of the professor.
- Supervised Research: Not much different than Independent Study. The professor helps here officially. Although in independent study also you get some guidance.
