## Some reviews of subjects that my friends pursued.
| Subject | Review from a student|
|---------|----------------------|
|Reinforcement Learning by Alina| Reinforcement Learning is the best course I have taken here at UB and I have taken various ML courses like Computer Vision, NLP, and ML. I say this because of following reasons - The courses' content and flow is structured beautifully. The difficulty always increases. The Prof. has made interaction in class fun. The only class where almost the entire batch interacted with each other. The projects are very interesting and structured. You won't have to worry about anything else except working on your project. Same with quizzes. The Prof. is super helpful and passionate. Her teaching exudes that. You can ask her anything. I liked the idea of reinforcement learning. The concept. That's why I decided to pursue it. The course was easy for me but you should definitely have the pre-requisites beforehand. namely, python, machine learning (somewhat computer vision). The course is not for someone who wants to take a job after masters. The future prospects of the course are purely research. Take it considering this into account.|
|Paralle and Distributed Processors by J.Zola| Took the course Cuz of the prof. I had talked to him prior to attending his class. He sold me on the course and the beauty of parallel programming . Also I was getting sick of all the ML/AI courses and wanted something different. Zola is a prof who enjoys teaching. He had the enthusiasm of a kid while teaching.And since it is a small class(only about 15 people) there was a lot of free-flow discussion. Definitely a difficult course. Exam questions are not straight forward. Requires you to use your brain. And the Prof does not give grace marks if you don’t do well. If you fail, you fail. That’s it. There is nothing I would want to change in this course. Maybe instead of 4 small assignments he could have given a project. But I beleive since it is a 600 course now, he is bringing in a project. This course should be take by anyone who is bored with shitty ML courses. Anyone who has an interest in parallel programming. Anyone who wants to learn about supercomputers and GPU programming. The major selling point for this course is that you do your assignments on UB’s HPC which is one of the country’s top High Performance Computing center. Seriously cool stuff. All assignments were in C++ . And they had to be run on the UB HPC which is seriously something cool to put on your resume. Assignments were really tough but you do get that satisfaction once you figure it out.
