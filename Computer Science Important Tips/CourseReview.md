## Some reviews of subjects that my friends pursued.
Reviews were given keeping the following points in mind: </br>
-why you took the course
-what you liked the course
-was it difficult or easy according to you
- what could be better/ what you did not liked
- who should take the course
- anything you can mention about the projects/assignments and the languages used in the course </br>

|---------|----------------------|
|Reinforcement Learning by Alina| Reinforcement Learning is the best course I have taken here at UB and I have taken various ML courses like Computer Vision, NLP, and ML. I say this because of following reasons - The courses' content and flow is structured beautifully. The difficulty always increases. The Prof. has made interaction in class fun. The only class where almost the entire batch interacted with each other. The projects are very interesting and structured. You won't have to worry about anything else except working on your project. Same with quizzes. The Prof. is super helpful and passionate. Her teaching exudes that. You can ask her anything. I liked the idea of reinforcement learning. The concept. That's why I decided to pursue it. The course was easy for me but you should definitely have the pre-requisites beforehand. namely, python, machine learning (somewhat computer vision). The course is not for someone who wants to take a job after masters. The future prospects of the course are purely research. Take it considering this into account.|
|Paralle and Distributed Processors by J.Zola| Took the course Cuz of the prof. I had talked to him prior to attending his class. He sold me on the course and the beauty of parallel programming . Also I was getting sick of all the ML/AI courses and wanted something different. Zola is a prof who enjoys teaching. He had the enthusiasm of a kid while teaching.And since it is a small class(only about 15 people) there was a lot of free-flow discussion. Definitely a difficult course. Exam questions are not straight forward. Requires you to use your brain. And the Prof does not give grace marks if you don’t do well. If you fail, you fail. That’s it. There is nothing I would want to change in this course. Maybe instead of 4 small assignments he could have given a project. But I beleive since it is a 600 course now, he is bringing in a project. This course should be take by anyone who is bored with shitty ML courses. Anyone who has an interest in parallel programming. Anyone who wants to learn about supercomputers and GPU programming. The major selling point for this course is that you do your assignments on UB’s HPC which is one of the country’s top High Performance Computing center. Seriously cool stuff. All assignments were in C++ . And they had to be run on the UB HPC which is seriously something cool to put on your resume. Assignments were really tough but you do get that satisfaction once you figure it out.|
|Computer Security by Marina Blanton| I only took the course cause I thought it will balance my course load. I didn't like the course. The course taught by Marina Blanton isn't tough in terms of difficulty, but it stupidly engaging. We had 7 assignments + mid terms + finals.|
|Machine Learning by Mingchen Gao| Took the course to better understand the implementations of mathematical models in machine learning. The emphasis on statistics/maths rather than programming was one of the best things about the course. The course would not be very challenging if the person has idea of basic statistical models and hands on experience of using python. Course should be taken by anyone who is interested in data science/analysis or wants to pursue there career in machine learning. the projects are pretty handy, the professor gives you only some instructions but most of the work of coding is to be done yourselves. It helps you inprove your coding skills. Python is the language usually used for any ML course|
|Pattern Recognition by Wen Dong| This course goes into the math and derivation of ML. This was a good add-on having taken intro to ML in the previous semester. I liked the professor. He did a good job explaining the concepts and was also happy to clear any doubts in his OH. The course will make you implement certain things from scratch and is def math heavy. It can feel a little difficult. However, the cutoff for A was super low. For the mid and final, he will have a revision and he will explain the kind of questions which will come in the exam. There is a lot to cover so he sometimes skips over topics. You will have to put in the effort if you want to understand. Anyone who wants to learn more about the math behind ML. This is a math and stats heavy course with proper derivations. They weren't too difficult. Usually took around a day. I wouldn't recommend starting on the last day. Languages allowed: python, R, and matlab Mid/final: open book. A little difficult but was graded leniently Misc: don't cheat. The bar for A is already low. Just finishing all the assignments and getting okayish marks in mid and final should allow you to get an A.|
| Computer Vision and Image Processing by David Doermann| One of the best course for you if you're interested in computer vision. It teaches you the basics. Took the course because of the professor. The projects were really challenging. Difficult, 100% heavy course. It had 5-6 quizzes, 5-6 homewoks, mid term, final and 3 projects. Course doesn't go into ML/DL much. It's just a basic image processing course and goes little into vision. If you're into computer vision, definitely take it. Quizzes and hws are all from what he teaches in class. Basic conceptual and numericals. 1st project was edge detection and template matching for texts with different sizes, background, color etc. You cannot use opencv. 2nd was image stitching from scratch. You can't use opencv library. Need to write code for feature matching, homography and ransac algorithm. 3rd was a group project of 2. There were many options but I chose the default one. Viola Jones algorithm for face detection. It's a pretty famous algorithm for face detection, you can find all the details online. You have to write all the code from scratch. All the codes were written in python. But we had freedom to use other languages like c++, java, c# etc.|
